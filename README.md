# Hello-World
Tutorial
My name is Austin Burkhart. I graduated Illinois State University with a bachelor's in mathematics. Now, I live in Chicago, IL with my fianc√© and cat. Currently, I work as a District Manager for a solar company called Sunrun. I love playing guitar for fun and working with my hands.
